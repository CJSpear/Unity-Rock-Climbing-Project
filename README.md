# Unity-Rock-Climbing-Project
A 360 Environment to view Boulders for Rock Climbing

Castle Hill is known for its world class bouldering & used for filming movies such as The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. 
In this 360 Environment you can take a tour castle hill get some cool information of the protected park
You can also check out the bouldering climbs of the area, both in 360 panoramic views & as an interactable 3D Model.


What I currently have below is the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) which you can explore castle hill and the boulders on a PC. 
In the future I will want to expand the scope of Rocks available, Rock locations & heights, retake images to a higher quality, get more angles for the reconstruction of boulders. 
On the software side I want to make this app mobile friendly and to be accessed as a webapp rather than a .exe program.

These models have low poly count and reduced textures so that in the future it can be uploaded to a webapp, as the ZIP file is about 500 MB. This may be changed to support the higher Res versions for the .exe program rather than the webapp

Applications used:
  Unity: Creating the 3D environment, Scripting & building the application
  Colmap & RealityCapture: For model reconstructions
  Blender: For baking textures/models
  Image Composite editor: Sitching Images 
  Meshlab: Editing the models produced

How to Run: Just download, extract Castle_Hill_App.zip file and run the .exe file

# Unity-Rock-Climbing-Project VR Version (Alpha)




NOTE:  This was the prototype version, made to be run in a VR headset

How to Run: Just download, extract VR Castle Hill.zip file and run the .exe file


The aim of this project is to produce a 3D environment of Rock-Climbing Boulders.
Currently when bouldering New Zealand it can be hard to figure out which climb is where and how to climb it using the guides given. Example (from a guide): Find the overhanging yellow prow. Sit start and climb straight up through good holds.
The aim of this project it to give a visual location of the boulder (using a 360 environment) and be able to manipulate the boulder using a reconstruction. So that you can view the rock and how you may climb it.
I have re-created this location in a VR environment so far, but will move onto a more desktop oriented version so others can use it online.

Locations include: Castle Hill & Flock Hill


Below you can see an example of a Reconstructed Rock in a 3D virtual Environment
